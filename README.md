# GroovyTunes: Your Music Spot ðŸŽµ

Hey there, fellow music enthusiasts! Welcome to GroovyTunes â€“ my little corner of the web where I'm tinkering with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a funky music player. ðŸŽ¶ As a budding web developer, I'm thrilled to have you join me on this journey. Let's dive in and have a blast!

## What's the Scoop?

So, what's the deal with GroovyTunes? Well, it's my pet project where I'm crafting a simple yet groovy music player. Here's the lowdown:

### What It Does:

- **Change Songs:** Tired of hearing the same old tune? Fear not! I'm cooking up a way to switch to your next favorite jam effortlessly.
  
- **Craft Playlists:** Load up your go-to tracks pronto. No more scrambling to find each song individually!

### What's on the Horizon?

Now, let's talk about what's coming up next â€“ I've got some cool plans in the pipeline:

- **Add Your Own Songs:** Ever wished you could strut your stuff on a player? Soon, you'll be able to load up your own tunes with ease.
  
- **Craft Your Playlists:** Get ready to play DJ and curate your playlists. Mix and match to your heart's content!

- **Favorites Section:** Keep your top tracks within reach by marking them as favorites. Quick access whenever the mood strikes!

- **Learning As I Go:** Just a heads up â€“ GroovyTunes is not just about music; it's also been my gateway into the captivating world of JavaScript. Picture this: a wide-eyed web enthusiast, armed with nothing but determination and a hefty dose of curiosity, diving headfirst into the depths of JavaScript. With each line of code, I've stumbled, I've soared, and I've discovered the incredible power of turning ideas into reality through programming.

## About This Project:

Hey there, fellow coders! Just a quick heads-up about GroovyTunes â€“ it's my very first dive into JavaScript, so bear with me as I find my groove. ðŸ•º I've set it up so that when you drop your music files into the 'songs' folder, they automatically become part of the music player. Pretty neat, right?

Now, here's the scoop â€“ it works like a charm on my local setup, but as luck would have it, deploying it live revealed some quirks. After a bit of head-scratching and a fair amount of Googling, it seems I might need to dip my toes into the realm of backend development. Ah, the joys of being a newbie web dev!

Oh, and about that playlist-switching functionality â€“ it's on the to-do list, but it's currently chilling in the 'unchecked' category. Fear not, though â€“ I'm on the case!

And hey, let's keep it real â€“ as a fledgling web developer, I'm all about that project-based learning. Sure, I might not always adhere to the best practices right off the bat, but rest assured, I'm soaking up knowledge like a sponge. So, when the time comes, expect a shiny new version of GroovyTunes, packed with all the bells and whistles â€“ and maybe a few less rookie mistakes!

Catch you on the flip side, fellow devs! ðŸŽ¸

Picture this: a wide-eyed web enthusiast, armed with nothing but determination and a hefty dose of curiosity, diving headfirst into the depths of JavaScript. With each line of code, I've stumbled, I've soared, and I've discovered the incredible power of turning ideas into reality through programming.

GroovyTunes isn't just about playing tunes â€“ it's a testament to my journey from JavaScript newbie to budding developer extraordinaire. Through trial and error, late-night debugging sessions, and countless "aha!" moments, I've honed my skills, one line of code at a time.

So, why should you hire me? Because behind every function, behind every line of code, lies a story of growth, resilience, and an unwavering passion for web development. With GroovyTunes as just the beginning, imagine the possibilities when you bring me onto your team â€“ together, we'll create something truly spectacular.

### Update:

Added new features for changing songs and managing music, but ran into a snag. Works fine on my server, but not online. Turns out, the app relies on folder structures for data, which doesn't fly online without a JSON file. Currently working on a fix to make it play nice everywhere!
